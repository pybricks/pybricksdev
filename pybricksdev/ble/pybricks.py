"""This module is used for Bluetooth Low Energy communications with devices
that provide the Pybricks GATT service.

Device identification and connection
------------------------------------

Devices that support this protocol MUST advertise the :data:`PYBRICKS_SERVICE_UUID:.
Connecting devices SHOULD then filter on this UUID to identify compatible devices.

After connecting, programs SHOULD read the Software Revision characteristic of
the Device Information Service to determine the Pybricks protocol version. This
version can be used to determine the capabilities of the device.
